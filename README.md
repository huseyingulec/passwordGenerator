# Password Generator

Live-demo -> https://passwordgenerator-huey.netlify.app/
## what I've done;

In this project, I have made progress in Javascript and learnt key subjects such as arrays, pushing a new element to an array and poping out the latest element from an array, objects, booleans, if-else condition statements, comparison operators, logical operators, for loops, the math object, return statements.

For this project, I was told to build a random 15-word password generator. I have added some features such as ability to set password length, click-on copy, setting characters for the passwords.

## what I was asked;
requirements;
build it from scratch,
generate two random passwords when the user clicks the button,
each password should be 15 characters long.

stretch goals;
ability to set password length,
add copy-on-click,
toggle symbols and numbers on/off.
